#### What open source contributions, research or visible leadership work have you done? If few, what 3 specific outcomes will you deliver in your first 90 days on the board in OWASP and how will members verify the progress?
<br>
I have authored and co-authored multiple research works with the Cloud Security Alliance, contributed to OWASP chapters in Chile and New York, and created global educational content such as the EC-Council’s *Hands-On Android Penetration Testing* course.  

If elected, in my first 90 days I will:  
1. Launch a **Global Chapter Health Dashboard** to track activity and support transparency.  
2. Create an **AI Security Task Force** within OWASP to address risks in AI systems.  
3. Hold **quarterly community calls** where members can verify progress and provide feedback.  
<br>

#### What do you see as the top three challenges for OWASP to increase impact and visibility worldwide? Please provide actionable plan which you can spearhead and lead if need be for the goals you plan to achieve
<br>
1. **Staying relevant in emerging domains** (AI, supply chain, cloud-native).  
   → I will build new working groups to produce concrete outputs in these fields.  

2. **Ensuring project and chapter sustainability.**  
   → I will pair projects with mentors and sponsors to reduce attrition and foster growth.  

3. **Expanding global inclusion.**  
   → I will lead a program to provide grants, mentorship, and translations for underrepresented regions like LATAM, Africa, and the Middle East.  
<br>

#### Several OWASP projects are stale and leads are unresponsive. If elected, what is your concrete, time bound plan to triage these projects, re-engage with inactive leads or relaunch based on clear criteria and timelines?
<br>
Within the first 6 months I will:  
- Publish a **project status report** identifying stale projects.  
- Reach out to inactive leads and give a **90-day response window**.  
- Relaunch projects by assigning new leads or archive them with community approval.  
- Establish a **mentorship program** to empower new leaders to take over.  
<br>

#### What kind of support will you provide for Arab countries in regard to trending legislation in security, privacy and data protection, for software, OT, and cloud? Will you plan for specific events to cover the growth of talents and skills in secure coding in this particular region?
<br>
I will:  
- Promote **regional OWASP Days** in Arab countries focused on secure coding and compliance (GDPR, NCA, local data laws).  
- Support **translation of flagship projects** like ASVS, SAMM, and OWASP Top 10 into Arabic.  
- Build **training initiatives** with local universities to grow secure coding skills.  
- Encourage cross-regional collaboration between Arab countries and other regions.
