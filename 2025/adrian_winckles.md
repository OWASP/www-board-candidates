#### About Me
![Image](#)
<br>
<br>
My name is Adrian Winckles, a cyber security professional, academic, and community leader with more than three decades of experience advancing global cyber resilience. My career has spanned academia, industry, and international organisations, where I have consistently focused on bridging the gap between research, education, and practice to build stronger and more secure digital ecosystems.

My involvement with OWASP began in 2011 when I jointly founded and continue to lead the Cambridge UK Chapter, hosting monthly community events that bring together practitioners, researchers, and students. In 2014, I was joint chair of OWASP Europe AppSec conference in Cambridge, UK and involved in all decision making parts of the delivery.

In 2015, I was co-opted to the OWASP European Board, where I contributed to multiple AppSec Europe conferences, including reviewing speaker and training proposals and helping with the multinational University Challenge to engage the next generation of security professionals.

Since 2019, I have served as Chair of the OWASP Education and Training Committee, helping to developing strategies for education, training, and certification that support OWASP's mission worldwide. I also lead two global OWASP projects: the **Distributed Web Threat Intelligence Honeypot**, which delivers open-source datasets for the community, and the **Open Application Security Curriculum Project**, designed to close critical skills gaps in application security.

Beyond OWASP, I have held leadership roles in professional bodies such as the British Computer Society and the UK Cybercrime Forensics SIG, contributing expertise to national initiatives and skills frameworks. As a Senior Lecturer and later Director of the Cyber Security & Networking Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University, I designed multiple degree programmes, supervised nine PhDs and over 250 MSc/BSc projects, and secured more than Â£500,000 in external research funding. My academic work has generated over 25 publications and informed EU and UK government policy and training programmes. Currently I am working at the Open University with a Lectureship in Cyber Security.

I bring to OWASP Board candidacy, extensive board-level experience, including my role as Director of Cyber East, supporting cyber innovation and skills development across the region. My work as co-founder and Research Director of ZORB Security further reflects my commitment to translating research into practical solutions.
