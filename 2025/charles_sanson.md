#### About Me
#![My photo](https://artcraft.net/images/Me_on_Moon4.jpg "my portrait")

<br>
<br>
My name is Charles Sanson.  Welcome to my OWASP Global Board of Directors candidacy page.
<br>


<br>
<br>

#### What open source contributions, research or visible leadership work have you done? If few, what 3 specific outcomes will you deliver in your first 90 days on the board in OWASP and how will members verify the progress?
<br>
<br>
I am a seasoned IT professional who has been leading IT developer teams for the past 20 years.
I have managed many high profile development initiatives where I had to define the SSDLC, enforce the secure code development practices leveraging the OWASP top ten, rally the teams and ensure the end product met or surpassed peer code review and Application Security scans.
<br>
In my first ninety days, I would prioritize the expansion of OWASP resources and projects on security issues in the area of Artificial Intelligence.
As current co-chair of the AJCU AI Special Interest Group, we, in Higher Ed, see that this new area has such a broad potential to expose users and data to breaches in ways that had never been expected before 2023. 
This new threat vector is also an opportunity for OWASP to show its importance to the community by rising to the challengess presented by this new vertical.
This is also an excellent way for us to recruit participants and funding from corporations that rely on our work to enhance their foundational security.
<br>
In essence, I would increase Member Engagement and Community Participation by developing a new pilot program, the "Developer-to-OWASP Bridge," focused on onboarding seasoned IT professionals into community leadership roles. This would include creating a clear, 90-day onboarding guide for new project leads, chapter officers, and committee members.
<br>
Second, I believe OWASP must be at the forefront of securing the next generation of applications, and that means focusing on Artificial Intelligence. I would use my leadership experience to drive new projects that address security risks in AI and machine learning systems, expanding on the GenAI Security Project.
<br>
Lastly, as board members are the financial stewards of this foundation, I would recommend that we implement a new, transparent financial reporting system. This would involve working with the Treasurer to create and publish a simple, easy-to-understand "OWASP Financial Snapshot" on a quarterly basis. This report would summarize the foundation's income, expenses, and budget against actuals, presented in a clear, public format for the community.

#### What do you see as the top three challenges for OWASP to increase impact and visibility worldwide? Please provide actionable plan which you can spearhead and lead if need be for the goals you plan to achieve
<br>
<br>
Based on my understanding of OWASP's mission, I see the top three challenges for the as:
1--- Geographic and Cultural Relevance: OWASP's impact is strongest in English-speaking and developed nations. A major challenge is making OWASP's projects and community truly accessible and relevant to developers and security professionals in diverse cultures and regulatory environments globally.
<br>
2--- Keeping Pace with Emerging Technologies: The rapid adoption of new technologies like AI, IoT, and serverless computing presents new security challenges that require a shift in focus. A challenge for OWASP is to move beyond its traditional scope and proactively create resources for these evolving threats.
<br>
3--- Translating Knowledge into Widespread Adoption: OWASP produces a wealth of resources, but the ultimate measure of its success is whether those resources are widely adopted in the development and security community. A key challenge is bridging the gap between project creation and practical, enterprise-level implementation.
<br>
Challenge 1: Lack of Geographic and Cultural Relevance
To address this challenge, I would spearhead a Global Content Localization Initiative.
I would form a special committee consisting of board members, chapter leaders, and key project contributors to create a formal localization framework. 
This would focus on identifying and prioritizing key documents for translation, starting with adding more localized versions of the OWASP Top 10 and the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). We would then engage with local chapters to recruit and empower multilingual volunteers to lead and review these translations.
<br>
Challenge 2: Keeping Pace with Emerging Technologies
To ensure OWASP remains relevant, I would lead a Future-Proofing OWASP Projects Initiative.
For this, I would establish and chair a new "Emerging Technologies Task Force" with a mandate to conduct a landscape analysis of new technology risks. This task force would have a fast-track process for approving and resourcing new projects that address security in areas like AI/ML, blockchain, and quantum computing. We would work to quickly build a core team around these new projects to ensure rapid development and releases.
<br>
Challenge 3: Translating Knowledge into Widespread Adoption
To bridge the gap between projects and practical implementation, I would personally lead a Corporate Partnership Program and initiate conversations with Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and security leaders from a few major corporations to understand their challenges in adopting OWASP projects. 
My goal would be to co-develop a "Corporate Adoption Kit" that provides a clear, step-by-step guide on how to integrate OWASP tools and resources into a company's Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), complete with metrics for demonstrating success to leadership.

<br>

#### Several OWASP projects are stale and leads are unresponsive. If elected, what is your concrete, time bound plan to triage these projects, re-engage with inactive leads or relaunch based on clear criteria and timelines?
<br>
<br>
If elected, I have a concrete, time-bound plan to address stale and unresponsive OWASP projects. My approach would be phased, again, over 90 days, with a focus on transparency, community involvement, and clear criteria for success.
<br>
Phase 1: Project Health Audit (Days 1-30)
My first step would be to lead a comprehensive Project Health Audit. I would work with the OWASP Foundation staff to systematically review the complete list of all projects and their last activity dates (commits, forum posts, documentation updates).
<br>
Phase 2: Re-engagement and New Leadership (Days 31-60)
For all projects identified as "Dormant" or "Stale," I would personally initiate a Project Re-engagement Campaign by reaching out to the existing project leads on record via multiple channels to understand their status and willingness to continue. Simultaneously, I would issue a public "Call for New Project Leads" for all projects without active leadership, clearly outlining the project's value and the support available from the Foundation.
<br>
Phase 3: Relaunch, Transition, or Archive (Days 61-90)
Based on the outcomes of the re-engagement campaign, I would oversee the final disposition of each project. We would either: 
Relaunch for strategically important projects where new leadership has been  confirmed.
Transition for projects with interested leads but a need for new direction, we would guide them in creating a new, focused project charter and help them secure the resources needed to transition from "Dormant" to "Active."
<br>
The last state would be to Archive projects that have no interest from new leads and are deemed no longer strategically critical. 
I would propose a board vote to formally archive these. These projects would be moved to a clear "OWASP Project Archive" section on the website, with a permanent link to their last known state, ensuring the community's work is preserved.

#### What kind of support will you provide for Arab countries in regard to trending legislation in security, privacy and data protection, for software, OT, and cloud? Will you plan for specific events to cover the growth of talents and skills in secure coding in this particular region?
<br>
<br>
Based on my research into the existing OWASP community, we have an opportunity to build upon the excellent work already underway in the region. If elected, my plan to support Arab countries would focus on two key areas: providing actionable guidance on trending legislation and fostering a thriving talent pipeline for secure coding.
<br>
Instead of creating new projects from scratch, I would work to create a specific "Regional Regulatory Working Group." Our support would be to provide the organizational framework and resources for the local community to lead this effort. 
I would empower local chapter leaders to convene a working group of legal and security professionals from across the region. Their mission would be to produce actionable guidance that maps regional legislation (such as Saudi PDPL, UAE privacy laws, etc.) to OWASP's existing projects for software, OT, and cloud.
<br>
To grow talent, I would recommend we take the successful, localized events and scale them into a regional, high-impact conference. We should spearhead the organization of the first-ever "OWASP MENA Secure Coding Summit." This would be a hybrid event, with a physical conference in a central hub like Dubai or Riyadh, and virtual attendance options for the entire region. The event's agenda would be built around a core curriculum of hands-on "Secure Coding Dojos" in both Arabic and English. This would formalize and expand the existing secure coding training already being done by local chapters.
<br>
Both of these initiatives could be spearheaded by me or someone else on behalf of the Board, but they should be built on the strength of the local community, ensuring that the resources are not just provided for the region, but are truly owned and driven by it.
